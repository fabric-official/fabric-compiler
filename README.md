Fabric Compiler

The Fabric Compiler is the core of Fabric 1.0 — Universal AI Fabric, a decentralized AI execution platform.
It transforms .fab source code into policy-enforced, forensic-grade execution artifacts, leveraging MLIR and LLVM for optimal performance, quantum coordination, and compliance enforcement.

🌟 Key Capabilities

🧠 Custom DSL Parser — Converts .fab modules into Fabric-specific ASTs
⚛️ FabricAtoms IR — Bit-level, auditable intermediate representation with mutation control
🔗 MLIR Dialect — Optimized lowering pipeline for agent execution and cross-device deployment
⚙️ LLVM Backend — High-performance code generation with policy-aware optimizations
🛡️ Compliance Enforcement — Built-in GDPR, HIPAA, and royalty tracking during compilation
🔒 SGX-Secured Runtime — Executes compiled agents in enclaves with full provenance
🛠️ CLI Tooling — Developer tools for building, auditing, and verifying agents
🌀 Quantum Extensions (Fabric 1.1) — Optional quantum coordination blocks and atomic rollback

🚀 Core Workflows

1. Building an Agent
fab build myagent.fab
Parses source code → Fabric IR
Applies policy checks and provenance annotations
Generates LLVM-optimized binaries for runtime execution
2. Auditing Compliance
fab audit myagent.fab
Inspects mutation policies, royalty splits, and privacy guarantees
Outputs a verifiable audit trail
3. Monitoring Atomic Execution
fab monitor atoms
Streams bit-level execution telemetry
Tracks energy budgets and atomic rollbacks
🔬 FabricAtoms IR

Fabric’s execution model is built on FabricAtoms — bit-level, policy-enforced primitives:

Protons: Immutable execution state
Electrons: Mutable, policy-constrained bits
Policy Blocks: Define privacy, integrity, royalty rules, and energy constraints
This enables:

Forensic provenance: Every bit mutation is tracked
Rollback & replay: Deterministic atomic state recovery
Quantum coordination: Multi-agent entanglement and synchronization
🛡️ Security and Compliance

✅ Secure Enclaves: Hardware-based trust for agent execution
✅ Provenance Ledger: Merkle-DAG tracking of all agent forks and executions
✅ Royalty Enforcement: On-chain XP and revenue sharing for every fork
✅ GDPR/HIPAA Alignment: Built-in data privacy and access controls
🧩 Planned Extensions

Fabric 1.1: QuantumCoordinationBlock, Atomic Rollback, Energy Ledger
Polyglot Frontends: Python, TypeScript, C++ transpilers
FabricGovernor: Meta-agent for automated agent synthesis
IDE Integration: VS Code extension with live audit feedback
